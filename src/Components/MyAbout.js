		<p>
		I'm an outgoing, resilient & tenacious individual with a drive to succeed. I'm not afraid to take on a challenge.<br/> 
		Music is one thing I can't live without, it is best while I'm out in nature & even better when I'm at home painting with headphones on.<br/>
		I've been known to be a bit of a book worm; moonlighting by reading mystery, scientific & horror novels <br/>
		I love learning new concepts & implementing them. I've always been intrigued by the design & mechanics of the universe.<br/>
		My long-term goal is to become a Digital Designer.<br/>
