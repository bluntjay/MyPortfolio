		<p>
		I'm a tenacious individual that is competent in any task that I'm given. 
		I'm an outgoing & resilient entity with a drive for success as I'm not afraid to take on a challenge.
		Music is one thing I can't live without, it is best while I'm out in nature & even better when I'm at home painting with headphones on.
		I've been known to be a bit of a book worm; reading mystery, scientific & horror novels.
		I am honest, direct, strong-willed, dutiful, responsible, practical & reliable.<br/>

		I studied with Life Choices through HyperionDev, working on multiple projects whilst learning various programming languages.
		I believe in adding value, simplicity & sustainability within projects, teamwork & cooperation. 
		I am always trying to challenge myself while improving my skills & knowledge.
		I love learning new concepts & implementing them. I've always been intrigued by the design & mechanics of the universe.
		I'm well-versed in Designing & my long-term goal is to become a Digital Designer.<br/>
